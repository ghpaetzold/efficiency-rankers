Training proportions:
	- Boundary has superior performance, but unstable with smaller amounts of data (needs entire ranking)
	- MLP: results are not apparent if test set is too small with respect to the training set, more stable, requires less data to surpass unsupervised approach
	
Evaluation correlation:
	- Ranking LS data available collected in binary form (coling 2016)
	- Rankings cannot be inferred: binary comparisons were distributed arbitrarily (not all the ones from a given instance were given to the same person)
	- Pearson and Spearman correlation 0.99 average correlation with binary decision Accuracy
	- Allows binary-made datasets for ranking to be evaluated through Accuracy (segway onto adaptive LS)
	
Adaptive LS:




Experiments:
	- Normal (proportion vs. Accuracy)
	- One for each user (same...)
	- One for each language/age band/proficiency/education level
	- Adding aspects as features (try different combinations)
	- Try adding more features...
